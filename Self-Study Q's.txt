1. Adaptive website will be the same as a desktop, but on mobile devices, you will
have to zoom in and out of the screen to see stuff. A fully responsive website will
let you be on any device and it will bring the website to the correct size for viewing.

2. Mobile first will be a website mainly made for mobile users, while a desktop first
website is mainly made for desktop users.

3. It will set the element to 62.5% of what ever rem you used.

4. Preprocessing in css makes it easier for a team to know what everyone is coding and can make it easier to code;

5. My favorite concept is the variable. A concept that gives me the most trouble is

on a huge website with muliple pages, mixins would be very useful.
